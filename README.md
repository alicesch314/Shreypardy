	         !!!  SHREYPARDY RULES !!!
******************************************************

	This game is a mixture of jeopardy and cards against humanity. 
	On a player's turn, they choose an points card from the screen, 
	a quantity of shots will appear on the screen associated with the
	 card, this is important to remember for later!
	 
	The question will then appear on the screen, the players write 
	down their best answer (whether it be accurate or funny is up to the players!). 
	If two people have the same answer at any point in the game, then that means Shrey 
	is too predictable and has to be punished, he takes a shot.

	Once everyone is done, Shrey choose his favourite or the best answer. 
	Shrey then guesses whose answer it was, if he is correct, then the winning 
	player takes the number of shots indicated on the card, otherwise, Shrey fills 
	his cup with 1/2 the amount of shots indicated.
	
	The player whose answer it was receives the points from the round, 
	and if they had chosen the question initially, they receive 1.5X the points.
	
	Finally, if Shrey's cup fills up he has to chug it, if his cup doesn't fill 
	up by the end of the game, he still has to chug it because it's more fun that way.	
	
	The game finishes once all the questions have been answered, and the 
	winning player is revealed. The winning player receives a prize!
